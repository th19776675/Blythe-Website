  <h1>HYDE PARK HI-FI NEEDS NEW LEADERSHIP</h1>
  <p>HPHF is crumbling as you read this very piece of writing. Unfortunately there have been unrevokable issues that we all saw coming. Luckily for all of us, there is such a strong community that has been built that I can easily provide potential replacements (as the new leader of Hyde Park Hi-Fi)</p>
