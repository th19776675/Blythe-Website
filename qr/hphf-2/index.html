      At what point do we have to admit to ourselves that we're the problem. To be honest, I'm getting sick of it. Life is all fucking the same. Same routine every god damn fucking day. 
      <br><br>
      I wake up. 
      <br><br>
      Don't even wash my face. 
      <br><br>
      Doomscroll Reddit until I realise the crushing expectation of the world, that I have conjured up in my mind (conveniently ignoring all of the bouts of nihilism and solipsism that serve entirely just to fuel my own self-centered cycle of woe), stops me from going any further. I have an endless guilt-release cycle in which I serve to solve problems in order to relieve guilt, which inevitable leads to guilt once I experience joy.
      <br><br>
      I spent three days tossing and turning about an accidentally sent message. <br> I think I'm TOO important.
      <br><br>
      My ego is far too big. It has allowed me to realise I am both the best and worst in the room. The ego has gone so far that it has looped back around into trying to be humble as it has realised that that's what makes people actually important.
      <br><br>
      Life is purely an extension of my misery. <br> The misery comes first. <br> Always first.
      <br><br>
      Never have I spent a full day of true unimaginative happiness. All my forms of happiness come from the imagination. Isn't that sad? I can't simply enjoy the moment. The essense of an experience is ruined. It's no longer a vessel for the human condition to react but is instead a yearning for the ideal. I imagine the castle I will live in. That brings me joy. Once I get that castle, where is the joy?

      My feet aren't large enough, either. I'm sick of it. It's not that they're too small. It's that they aren't large enough. I know many short people, ones I will not name, that have huge honking feet. Many tall people with small, insignifcant feet. It doesn't matter to me. What does matter is my opinion. I know what I want, and I want large feet.

      Arthur Read, the titular character from the hit television programme, "Arthur", is an aardvark. That is funny because he does not look like one. Aardvark is a grammatically-sound rhyme with Hyde Park, hence Aardvark Hi-Fi.
